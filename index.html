                <p>Gumby is a dark green clay figure created by <b>Art Clokey</b> in the early 1950s.  He was in 233 episodes on American television series. He has become well known as an example of stop motion clay animation. He has become a cultural icon. There have been many tributes and parodies, including a video game and toys.</p>

                <h2 id="history-header">History</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1953:</b> first animated film, a 1953 three-minute student film called <b>Gumbasia</b>, a surreal montage of moving and expanding lumps of clay set to music in a parody of Disney's Fantasia. Gumbasia was created in the "kinesthetic" style taught by Clokey's USC professor Slavko Vorkapić, described as "massaging of the eye cells." Much of Gumby's look and feel was inspired by this technique of camera movements and editing.</li>
                    <li><b>1955:</b> In 1955, Clokey showed Gumbasia to movie producer <b>Sam Engel</b>, who encouraged him to develop his technique by animating figures into children's stories. Clokey moved forward, producing a pilot episode featuring the character Gumby.</li>
                    <li>The name "Gumby" came from the muddy clay found at Clokey's grandparents' farm that his family called "gumbo".</li>
                    <li>In 1955 and 1956, 25 eleven-minute episodes aired on NBC.</li>
                    <li><b>The Gumby Show</b> featured not only Clokey's puppet films, but also interviews and games.</li>
                    <li>In 1959, The Gumby Show entered syndication, and more episodes were produced in the 1960s.</li>
                    <li>The show ended in 1969.</li>
                    <li>In 1987, the original Gumby shorts enjoyed a revival on home video. The following year, Gumby appeared in <b>The Puppetoon Movie</b>.</li>
                    <li>This renewed interest led to a reincarnation of the series consisting of 99 new seven-minute episodes produced for television syndication in association with Lorimar-Telepictures in 1987</li>
                    <li>In 1995, Clokey's production company produced an independently released theatrical film, <b>Gumby: The Movie</b>, marking the character's first feature-length adventure.</li>
                    <li>On March 16, 2007, YouTube announced that all Gumby episodes would appear in their full-length form on its site, digitally remastered and with their original soundtracks.</li>
                    <li>In 2012, Me-TV began airing Gumby on weekend morning, in its weekend morning animation block.The show remained part of the channel's programming until the end of the year.</li>
                    <li>On April 8, 2015, it was announced that a new Gumby series was in the works, co-produced by the Jim Henson Company.</li>
                </ul>
